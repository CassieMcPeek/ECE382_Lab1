ECE382_Lab1 Assembly Language "A Simple Calculator"
===========
# Purpose
  The purpose of this lab was to use our knowledge from class and write an assembly language program that interprets a series of operands and operations and then stores the results. This is also known as an assembly language calculator. There were 3 functionalities our code was required to meet. The first implemented four operations: add_op, sub_op, Clr_op, and end_op. The second set the maximum value to 255, if the result exceeded 255 and the minimum value to zero is the result was less than zero. The final functionality implemented a multiplication operation.
